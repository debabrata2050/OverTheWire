## Write Up:<br>

In this, a filename containing "space" must be read.<br>
Normally, when we execute a command (for example, cat) without " " in the file name, they split into two files separated by that space.<br>
So, in this scenario, we have a specific syntax to indicate that this is a single file with gaps contained within it.<br>

Syntax: `cat '{file name with space}'` or `cat "{file name with space}"`<br>

## Solution:<br>
Command: `cat "spaces in this filename"`<br>
